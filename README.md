Compile the Java File: Save the provided Java code in a file named TicTacToeGUI.java. Open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:

Run the Program: After successful compilation, run the program by executing the following command:
Play the Game: Once the program starts, a window titled "Tic Tac Toe" will appear. You will see a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell of the grid corresponds to a button. Player 1 starts the game by clicking on any button. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their respective symbols ('X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2).

Gameplay: The game proceeds until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

Game End: When a player wins, a message will appear indicating the winner. If the game ends in a draw, a message will indicate that as well.

Restart: After the game ends, you can close the window and rerun the program to play again.

Exiting the Program: To exit the program, simply close the window or terminate the program from the command prompt or terminal.

Follow these steps, and you'll be able to run and play the Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Java Swing GUI.
